# Part I The Fundamentals of Machine Learning
## Chapter 1 The Machine Learning Landscape

**What Is Machine Learning?**
- Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.
- [Machine learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —Arthur Samuel, 1959
- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. —Tom Mitchell, 1997

**Why Use Machine Learning?**
1. First you would examine what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or phrases (such as “4U”, “credit card”, “free”, and “amazing”) tend to come up a lot in the subject line. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and other parts of the email.
2. You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns were detected.
3. You would test your program and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it was good enough to launch.

**To summarize, machine learning is great for:**
- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of finetuning or long lists of rules (a machine learning model can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach)
- Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution (the best machine learning techniques can perhaps find a solution)
- Fluctuating environments (a machine learning system can easily be retrained on new data, always keeping it up to date) Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data

**Examples of Applications**
1. Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them
2. Detecting tumors in brain scans
3. Automatically classifying news articles
4. Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums
5. Summarizing long documents automatically
6. Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant
7. Forecasting your company’s revenue next year, based on many performance metrics
8. Making your app react to voice commands
9. Detecting credit card fraud
10. Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a different marketing strategy for each segment
11. Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful diagram
12. Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past purchases
13. Building an intelligent bot for a game

**Types of Machine Learning Systems**
- Supervised learning
  In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels
- Unsupervised learning
  In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled
- Semi-supervised learning
  Since labeling data is usually time-consuming and costly, you will often have plenty of unlabeled instances, and few labeled instances. Some algorithms can deal with data that’s partially labeled. This is called semi-supervised learning
